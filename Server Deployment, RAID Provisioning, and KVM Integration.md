# MITT-PRACTICUM

## Server Deployment, RAID Provisioning, and KVM Integration

### Overview

As part of my practicum at MITT, I participated in deploying, configuring, and troubleshooting enterprise servers in a real-world IT environment. My responsibilities included hardware preparation, RAID storage implementation (Dell & HP), and the integration of a hardware KVM switch for efficient rack management. The project also covered data center-level cabling, network device setup, and collaborative teamwork.

### Process Summary

#### 1. Server Hardware Preparation

- Assembled and verified the physical setup of Dell and HP enterprise servers.
- Checked RAM, drive installation, and completed all power and data cable connections.
- Created a **Proxmox VE bootable installation USB** using Rufus for OS deployment.

#### 2. RAID Configuration

- **Dell PowerEdge:**
  - Accessed the PERC RAID controller during boot (`Ctrl+R`).
  - Verified SAS/SATA disk recognition, troubleshot missing drives as needed.
  - Created new Virtual Disks (VDs) with RAID levels (0/1/5/10), named and initialized each group.
- **HP ProLiant:**
  - Entered RAID configuration utility with `Ctrl+C`.
  - Detected and troubleshot disk recognition, created and initialized logical drives using proper RAID levels.

#### 3. KVM Switch Integration

- Integrated a **Belkin 4-port USB+VGA KVM switch** for multi-host console access.
- Connected each server's VGA and USB ports to the color-coded KVM cables.
- Verified seamless keyboard, mouse, and display switching between up to four physical servers.

#### 4. Network & Rack Awareness

- Worked with a topology including Dell/HP servers, Fortinet switches, and a SonicWall router (WAN uplink).
- Gained hands-on experience with structured cabling, rack layout, and logical port planning.

### Team Context & Personal Contribution

- **Proxmox bootable USB creation** and OS installation preparation.
- **Full RAID configuration** on both Dell and HP servers (including troubleshooting all disk/initialization issues).
- **KVM switch integration** for centralized management of multiple hosts.
- **Documentation** of all configuration steps and encountered issues.
- Collaborated with team members on hardware compatibility and cable management, while independently handling the key configuration tasks.

### Professional Insight

This project provided real-world experience in enterprise server deployment, RAID provisioning, and KVM integration. I developed practical skills in hardware configuration, BIOS/RAID setup, and device documentation. These competencies are directly applicable to roles in network and system administration.

### Cognitive Effort and Problem-Solving Log

During this project, significant time and energy were dedicated not just to executing tasks, but to understanding complex issues, troubleshooting unexpected hardware/software behaviors, and iteratively refining solutions. For example:

- Spent over 1 hour diagnosing RAID disk detection issues, including consulting instructor, swapping drives, and verifying controller settings.
- Invested multiple cycles in understanding KVM switch integration, testing various connection combinations, and confirming multi-host control functionality.
- Engaged in peer discussions and online research to validate network topology plans and hardware compatibility.

This cognitive investment enabled rapid adaptation and resilient problem-solving, contributing directly to my professional growth—even when the visible 'output' seemed limited.
