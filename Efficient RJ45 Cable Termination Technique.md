## Efficient RJ45 Cable Termination Technique

During today’s practicum, the instructor Victor Chavez demonstrated a quicker and more efficient way to insert the twisted pair wires into the RJ45 connector.

Instead of trimming the wires too short at the beginning, it's better to **leave them slightly longer**. This gives me more room to work with and makes alignment easier.

The key steps are:

1. **Hold all eight wires together in one hand.**
2. **Pull and straighten the wires**, back and forth, to remove their natural twists and curves.
3. **Align the wires in the correct T568B order.**
4. **Push all the wires into the connector in a single smooth motion.**

> This method significantly reduces the time spent adjusting individual wires and helps ensure a clean, accurate fit.

#### Summary:
- Leave the wires a bit longer than usual.
- Straighten and align them with your fingers.
- Insert all eight wires into the RJ45 connector together.

This technique is especially useful for beginners, as it improves both **speed** and **accuracy** during cable termination.
