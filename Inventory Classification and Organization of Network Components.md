## Inventory Classification and Organization of Network Components

###  Role & Objective
As part of a network deployment preparation task, I was responsible for organizing and categorizing a large volume of networking accessories, including transceivers, fiber cables, and Ethernet patch cables.  
The goal was to improve accessibility and accuracy for the upcoming equipment rollout.

###  Actions Taken
- Inspected and verified part numbers on various SFP and SFP+ transceivers (e.g., Cisco GLC-SX-MM, Brocade 10G Active FCoE modules)
- Sorted transceivers by:
  - Type: 1G / 10G  
  - Protocol: Ethernet / FCoE  
  - Distance: SR / LR
- Grouped fiber optic cables by:
  - Length (e.g., 1m, 3m, 5m)  
  - Connector type 
- Classified Ethernet patch cables by category and length
- Cross-checked product labels and packaging information 
- Applied ESD-safe (Electrostatic Discharge) handling procedures for sensitive equipment
- Labeled and arranged components in clearly segmented compartments for fast retrieval

###  Outcome & Value
- Improved inventory clarity, reducing time spent locating correct parts during deployment
- Prevented setup errors caused by cable mismatch or unlabeled modules
- Enhanced readiness for future installations and troubleshooting activities
